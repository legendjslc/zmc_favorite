###   [datart](https://github.com/running-elephant/datart)
新一代数据可视化开放平台，支持报表、仪表板、大屏、分析和可视化数据应用的敏捷构建。

### [terriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs)
TerriaJS is a library for building rich, web-based geospatial data explorers, used to drive National Map, Digital Earth Australia Map, NSW Spatial Digital Twin and NEII Viewer (and many others). It uses Cesium and WebGL for a full 3D globe in the browser with no plugins. It gracefully falls back to 2D with Leaflet on systems that can't run Cesium. It can handle catalogs of tens of thousands of layers, with dozens of geospatial file and web service types supported. It is almost entirely JavaScript in the browser, meaning it can even be deployed as a static website, making it simple and cheap to host.

# [dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster)
Dagster is an orchestrator that's designed for developing and maintaining data assets, such as tables, data sets, machine learning models, and reports.

You declare functions that you want to run and the data assets that those functions produce or update. Dagster then helps you run your functions at the right time and keep your assets up-to-date.

Dagster is built to be used at every stage of the data development lifecycle - local development, unit tests, integration tests, staging environments, all the way up to production.
